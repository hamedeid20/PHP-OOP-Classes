### OOP-Classes
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've shared a collection of PHP classes based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This library aims to simplify the development of stable and maintainable PHP applications.

These classes provide a range of tools and features to facilitate code organization and achieve effective interaction between application components. Whether you're a PHP programming beginner or an experienced developer, you can use these classes as a foundation for your next project or as a tool to better understand and learn object-oriented programming concepts.
